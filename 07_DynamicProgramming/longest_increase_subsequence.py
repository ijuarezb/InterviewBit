# Longest Increasing Subsequence
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/
#
# Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.
#
# In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements are in strictly
# increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
# This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
# In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
#
# Example :
#
# Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
# Output : 6
# The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]
