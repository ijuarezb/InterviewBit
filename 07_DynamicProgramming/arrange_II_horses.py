# Arrange II
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/arrange-ii/
#
# You are given a sequence of black and white horses, and a set of K stables numbered 1 to K.
# You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions
# are satisfied:
#
#         You fill the horses into the stables preserving the relative order of horses.
#         For instance, you cannot put horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1.
#         You have to preserve the ordering of the horses.
#         No stable should be empty and no horse should be left unaccommodated.
#         Take the product (number of white horses * number of black horses) for each
#         stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum
#         among all possible accommodation arrangements
#
# Example:
#
# Input: {WWWB} , K = 2
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
# We have 3 choices {W, WWB}, {WW, WB}, {WWW, B}
# for first choice we will get 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.
# for second choice we will get 2*0 + 1*1 = 1.
# for third choice we will get 3*0 + 0*1 = 0.
#
# Of the 3 choices, the third choice is the best option.
#
# If a solution is not possible, then return -1
