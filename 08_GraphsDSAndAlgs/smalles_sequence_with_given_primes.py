# Smallest sequence with given Primes

#
# Given three prime number(p1, p2, p3) and an integer k. Find the first(smallest) k integers which
# have only p1, p2, p3 or a combination of them as their prime factors.
#
# Example:
#
# Input :
# Prime numbers : [2,3,5]
# k : 5
#
# If primes are given as p1=2, p2=3 and p3=5 and k is given as 5, then the sequence of first 5 
# integers will be:
#
# Output:
# {2,3,4,5,6}
#
# Explanation :
# 4 = p1 * p1 ( 2 * 2 )
# 6 = p1 * p2 ( 2 * 3 )
#
# Note: The sequence should be sorted in ascending order
#
