# Least Common Ancestor
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/least-common-ancestor/
#
# Find the lowest common ancestor in an unordered binary tree given two values in the tree.
#
# Lowest common ancestor : the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or
# directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants.
#
# Example :
#
#         _______3______
#        /              \
#     ___5__          ___1__
#    /      \        /      \
#    6      _2_     0        8
#          /   \
#          7    4
#
# For the above tree, the LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
#
# LCA = Lowest common ancestor
# Please note that LCA for nodes 5 and 4 is 5.
#
# 1. You are given 2 values. Find the lowest common ancestor of the two nodes represented 
#    by val1 and val2
# 2. No guarantee that val1 and val2 exist in the tree. If one value doesn’t exist in 
#    the tree then return -1.
# 3. There are no duplicate values.
# 4. You can use extra memory, helper functions, and can modify the node struct but, 
#    you can’t add a parent pointer.
