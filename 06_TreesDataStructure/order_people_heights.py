# Order of People Heights
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/order-of-people-heights/
#
# You are given the following :
#
# A positive number N
# Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
# Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons
#
# >>> who are taller than P >>> AND <<< standing in front of P <<<
#
# You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height
#
# Consider that heights will be unique
#
# Example
#
# Input :
# Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
# InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
# Output :
# actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4
# So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in
# front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.
#
# For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.
#
# You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
