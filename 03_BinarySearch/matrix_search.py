# Matrix Search
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/matrix-search/
#
# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
#
# This matrix has the following properties:
#
#         Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
#         The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.
#
# Example:
#
# Consider the following matrix:
#
# [
#   [1,   3,  5,  7],
#   [10, 11, 16, 20],
#   [23, 30, 34, 50]
# ]
#
# Given target = 3, return 1 ( 1 corresponds to true )
#
# Return 0 / 1 ( 0 if the element is not present, 1 if the element is present ) for this problem
#
