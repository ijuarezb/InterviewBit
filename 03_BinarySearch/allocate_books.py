# Allocate Books
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/allocate-books/
#
# N number of books are given.
# The ith book has Pi number of pages.
# You have to allocate books to M number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted
# to a student is minimum. A book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each student has 
# to be allocated at least one book. Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: 
# A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.
#
# NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible
#
# Input:
#
# List of Books
# M number of students
#
# Your function should return an integer corresponding to the minimum number.
#
# Example:
#
# P : [12, 34, 67, 90]
# M : 2
#
# Output : 113
#
# There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed in following fashion :
#   1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]
#       Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
#   2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]
#       Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages
#   3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]
#       Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages
#
# Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.
