# Painter's Partition Problem
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/painters-partition-problem/
#
# You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available
# and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get
# this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint
# contiguous sections of board.
#
#         2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
#         cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
#         A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
#         configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
#         invalid.
#
# Return the ans % 10000003
#
# Input :
# K : Number of painters
# T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
# L : A List which will represent length of each board
#
# Output:
#      return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
#
# Example
#
# Input :
#   K : 2
#   T : 5
#   L : [1, 10]
#
# Output : 50
