# Sum of pairwise Hamming Distance
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/sum-of-pairwise-hamming-distance/
#
# Hamming distance between two non-negative integers is defined as the number of positions at
# which the corresponding bits are different.
#
# For example,
#
# HammingDistance(2, 7) = 2, as only the first and the third bit differs in the binary
# representation of 2 (010) and 7 (111).
#
# Given an array of N non-negative integers, find the sum of hamming distances of all pairs of
# integers in the array.
#
# Return the answer modulo 1000000007.
#
# Example
#
# Let f(x, y) be the hamming distance defined above.
#
# A=[2, 4, 6]
#
# We return,
# f(2, 2) + f(2, 4) + f(2, 6) +
# f(4, 2) + f(4, 4) + f(4, 6) +
# f(6, 2) + f(6, 4) + f(6, 6) =
#
# 0 + 2 + 1
# 2 + 0 + 1
# 1 + 1 + 0 = 8
