# Possibility of finishing all courses given pre-requisites
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/possibility-of-finishing-all-courses-given-prerequisites/
#
# There are a total of N courses you have to take, labeled from 1 to N. Some courses may have prerequisites,
# for example to take course 2 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [1,2].
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all
# courses. return 1/0 if it is possible/not possible.
# The list of prerequisite pair are given in two integer arrays B and C where B[i] is a prerequisite for C[i].
#
# Example: If N = 3 and the prerequisite pairs are [1,2] and [2,3], then you can finish courses in the following
# order: 1, 2 and 3. But if N = 2 and the prerequisite pairs are [1,2] and [2,1], then it is not possible for
# you to finish all the courses.
