# Merge Two Sorted Lists
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
#
# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list.
# The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and should also be sorted.
#
# For example, given following linked lists :
#
#   5 -> 8 -> 20
#   4 -> 11 -> 15
#
# The merged list should be :
#
# 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#	def __init__(self, x):
#		self.val = x
#		self.next = None
