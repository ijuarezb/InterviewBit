# Permutations
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/permutations/
#
# Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.
#
# Example:
#
# [1,2,3] will have the following permutations:
#
# [1,2,3]
# [1,3,2]
# [2,1,3]
# [2,3,1]
# [3,1,2]
# [3,2,1]
#
#     NOTE
#
#         No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.
#         For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.
#
#     Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.
#     Example : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python.
#     If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.
