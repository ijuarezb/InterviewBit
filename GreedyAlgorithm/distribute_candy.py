# Distribute Candy
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/distribute-candy/
#
# There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
#
#  You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
# Each child must have at least one candy.
# Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
# What is the minimum candies you must give?
#
# Sample Input :
#
# Ratings : [1 2]
# Sample Output :
#
# 3
# The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is
# its neighbor. So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2+1 = 3 candies need to be given out.
#
# Input 2:
#     A = [1, 5, 2, 1]
#
# Output 2:
#     7
#
# Explanation 2:
#     Candies given = [1, 3, 2, 1]
