# Min Jumps Array
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-jumps-array/
#
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
#
# Example :
# Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
#
# The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
#
# If it is not possible to reach the end index, return -1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= N <= 1e6
# 0 <= A[i] <= 50000
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
