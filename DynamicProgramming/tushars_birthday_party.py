#
# As it is Tushar’s Birthday on March 1st, he decided to throw a party to all his friends at 
# TGI Fridays in Pune.  Given are the eating capacity of each friend, filling capacity of each 
# dish and cost of each dish. A friend is satisfied if the sum of the filling capacity of dishes 
# he ate is equal to his capacity. Find the minimum cost such that all of Tushar’s friends are 
# satisfied (reached their eating capacity).
#
# NOTE:
#
#     Each dish is supposed to be eaten by only one person. Sharing is not allowed.
#     Each friend can take any dish unlimited number of times.
#     There always exists a dish with filling capacity 1 so that a solution always exists.
#
# Input Format
#
# Friends : List of integers denoting eating capacity of friends separated by space.
# Capacity: List of integers denoting filling capacity of each type of dish.
# Cost :    List of integers denoting cost of each type of dish.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= Capacity of friend <= 1000
# 1 <= No. of friends <= 1000
# 1 <= No. of dishes <= 1000
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#     2 4 6   # Friend's capacity, i.e. 2 friends, with 4 and 6 capacities.
#     2 1 3   # Dish's filling capacity, i.e. 2 type of dishes with filling capcities of 1 and 3.
#     2 5 3   # Cost of each type of dish, i.e. 2 different dishes with cost, 5 and 3.
#
# Output:
#     14
#
# Explanation:
#     First friend will take 1st and 2nd dish, second friend will take 2nd dish twice.  
#     Thus, total cost = (5+3)+(3*2)= 14
