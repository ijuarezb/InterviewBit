#
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
#
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
#
# Note:
# You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
#
# Example :
#
# Input : [1 2 1 2]
# Output : 2
#
# Explanation :
#   Day 1 : Buy
#   Day 2 : Sell
#   Day 3 : Buy
#   Day 4 : Sell
